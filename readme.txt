Biorhythm Theory states that our lives are influenced by a Physical,
Emotional, and Intellectual cycle which begin at birth. 
At birth, all three states start at the critical point and begin to rise 
to a positive peak, then cycle to a low point. 
On a day where the cycle crosses the critical point your abilities can vary wildly.
