<H2>Biorhythm - Technical Notes</H2>
<P>Biorhythm is a Java2 Application. The key design goals for
Biorhythm were:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Deployment flexibility. Biorhythm can be deployed as an
	Applet, a Standalone Application, a Java Web Start Application, or a
	JavaBean all using the same jar file.</P>
	<LI><P>Design Simplicity. Although Biorhythm has gotten rather
	large, it is based on the industry-standard MVC
	(model-view-controller) architecture with simple base classes.</P>
</UL>
<P>The question I am asked most is, &quot;How do I calculate a
Biorhythm for a particular date and graph it.&quot; Well, just follow
these steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>First figure out how many days the date is into the current
	cycle.<BR>Remainder of: Days from birthday / days in cycle</P>
	<LI><P>Next figure out the strength of the signal (It starts at zero
	an follows a sine wave to +1, 0, -1, and back to 0)<BR>Convert the
	remainder to radians and take the sine.</P>
	<LI><P>Plot it! (Okay this is an over simplification, but basically
	that's it!)</P>
</OL>
<P>Biorhythm is freeware. You can look at the source, copy it, use
it. You just can't remove the copyright notice or sell it.</P>
<P>Here is the zip of this distribution (including the source code):
<A HREF="../src/biorhythm.zip">biorhythm.zip</A> (you may have to right-click and
select download file) If you want to put biorhythm on another
web-server just unzip this and place the files in your directory
(tomcat compatible servers work best).</P>
<P>All of the source code is also here on-line. To browse my source
directory, <A HREF="../src/">click here</A>.</P>
<P>Many thanks to the people who have sent in the translations for
biorhythm.</P>
